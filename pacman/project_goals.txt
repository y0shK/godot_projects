Pacman goals

0. implement ideas learned from jetpack 2d runner game

	well-sculpted SceneTree
	use the OOP paradigm (lots of scenes - like Java classes - & instantiation)
	use globals for relevant variables (score, possibly health??)

1. learn top-down game with restricted arena movement (just one tilemap)
	emphasis on how to literally create one such screen
	useful for roguelikes, 2D action games, etc. (top down tilemap style)

2. code basic AI enemy (ghosts, each with a specific heuristic)
