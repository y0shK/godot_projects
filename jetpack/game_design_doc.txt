GDD

1. player
	hold space, Dave gets propelled up
	(otherwise, he falls)

	[x] basic physics
	[ ] jetpack hover TBD

	[x] otherwise, autoruns
	(use GMTK suggestion of having scene scroll and player stationary)

2. scene
	autoscroll to the left

	[x] parallax background

3. random obstacles
	need to jump - if don't, collision on ground -> death
	need to not jump - if jump, collision -> death

4. powerups (like Temple Run modifiers)	
	high score adder (+ 1000 to score)
	double coins
	invincibility for 10s

5. score
	score gets added per second (just survive) like Temple Run

6. jetpack
	once basic platformer is created, work on jetpack logic
	(if spacebar is held, "hover" instead of falling like Mario)
